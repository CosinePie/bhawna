            1. control of the source of infection. In the epidemic season, if there are prodromal symptoms should be
            early antibiotic treatment. \n
            2. cut off the transmission route, because the pertussis bacillus is weak to the outside world, 
            there is no need for disinfection treatment, but the indoor ventilation should be maintained, the clothes 
            should be exposed to sunlight, and the sputum and mouth and nose secretions should be disinfected."

            respiratory system."

  utter_asthmatic_bronchitis/description:
  - text: "Asthmatoid Bronchitis is also known as asthmatic bronchitis. It refers to a group of asthmatic infantile acute bronchitis, an allergic, often associated with respiratory infections. The main pathological basis of acute asthmatic bronchitis is bronchial smooth muscle spasm, microvascular leakage, mucosal edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and reversible airway obstruction caused by increased secretion.the trachea and bronchus of infants and young children are relatively narrow, and the surrounding elastic fibers are well developed."

  utter_asthmatic_bronchitis/prevention:
  - text: "Prevention of Asthmatoid Bronchitis :-\n
            1. For children with asthmatic bronchitis, attention should be paid to the family and children's own 
            allergic history, eosinophilia examination, serum ige levels and so on.
            if bronchial asthma is suspect, early prevention and treatment of asthma should be given. "

  utter_ards/description:
  - text: "Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome is abbreviated as ards. It is a secondary syndrome characterized by acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia and also known as shock lungs, traumatic lungs and so on. This type of acute respiratory failure in adults causes shock, severe infection, craniocerebral injury, severe trauma, fat embolism during fracture, excessive transfusion infusion, dic, inhaled irritating gases, oxygen poisoning, long-term use of respirators, cardiopulmonary bypass, coma or aspiration after general anesthesia, burns, etc."

  utter_ards/prevention:

            1. Patients with high-risk should be closely observed, strengthen monitoring, when the respiratory rate is low, pao2 is reduced, and other lung injury performance should be given early.\n
            2. Respiratory support and other effective prevention and intervention measures should be taken to prevent further development of ards and important organ damage."

  utter_ards/cause:
  - text: "Causes of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome :-\n
            ARDS happens when the lungs become severely inflamed from an infection or injury. The inflammation causes fluid from nearby blood vessels to leak into the tiny air sacs in your lungs, making breathing increasingly difficult.\n
            1. Pneumonia or severe flu\n
            2. Taking excessive heroin or salicylate\n
            3. Bacteria, viruses and pulmonary infection caused by fungi, etc."

  utter_amniotic_fluid_inhalation/prevention:
  - text: "Prevention of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome :-\n
            1. the key to prevention is prevention of intrauterine or hypoxia in the fetus. It is very necessary for the mother to do prenatal checkup regularly. When the fetus has signs of intrauterine asphyxia, the delivery should be terminated as soon as possible.\n 
            2. The longer the hypoxia, the possibility of inhaling amniotic fluid and the amount of amniotic fluid inhaled will be larger, and long-term intrauterine hypoxia can also cause fetal brain damage. \n
            3. The nasal mucus is extremely important and the key to reducing the onset. health care, nursing staff through the suffocation resuscitation treatment and qualified to go to work is necessary for amniocentesis aspiration pneumonia after treatment, the prognosis is good, most children can heal, and leave no sequelae."

  utter_amniotic_fluid_inhalation/cause:
  - text: "Causes of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome :-\n
            1. any factor causes hypoxia in the fetus or intrauterine as hypoxemia stimulates the fetal respiratory center, wheezing-like respiration occurs, causing amniotic fluid to be inhaled into the respiratory tract. \n
            2. Amniotic fluid is quickly absorbed by the alveolar capillaries after inhalation. sebum in the amniotic fluid and exfoliated keratinized epithelial cells can cause chemical chemistry in the alveoli. "

            1. Experiments have shown that after eating aphid eggs, the larvae migrate to the lungs and the typical lung manifestations and eosinophils can occur.\n
            2. Other parasites causing this disease include hookworms, filars, aphids, ginger worms, trichinella, and amoeba.  \n
            3. The disease is seasonally prevalent in some areas, so it is speculated that environmental antigen factors are also a possible cause in some areas.\n
            4. Sometimes the disease can also occur by inhaling pollen. pathological changes are mainly located in the interstitial lung, alveolar wall and terminal bronchiole wall, with irregular eosinophil infiltration, and sometimes a cluster of eosinophils can be seen in the alveoli, rarely involving blood vessels."

  utter_loblar_pneumonia/description:
  - text: "Lobarpneumonia is also known as pneumococcal pneumonia. It is an acute pulmonary parenchymal inflammation with a large leafy distribution caused by bacterial infections such as pneumococci. Occurs in young men and winter and spring, common causes are cold, rain, drunk or general anesthesia, sedative overdose, etc. When these causes make the respiratory defense function weakened, the bacteria invade the alveoli through the allergic reaction to make the alveolar wall capillary permeability is enhanced, serum and cellulose are exuded, and bacteria in protein-rich exudates rapidly multiply and spread to adjacent lung tissue, affecting a segment of the lung or the entire lobe. In recent years, typical lobar pneumonia has been rarely seen due to the use of a large number of powerful antibiotics. \n
           Clinical symptoms -> sudden chills, high fever, chest pain, cough, cough and rust, and some patients have nausea, vomiting, irritability, paralysis and other digestive and neurological symptoms.\n
           Signs -> acute illness, shortness of breath, nose flapping, early lung signs are not obvious or only respiratory sound reduction and pleural friction sound; consolidation period can have typical signs, such as weakened respiratory movements on the affected side, increased vocal fibrillation, percussion dullness, auscultation reduced breath sounds, with wet rales or pathological bronchial breath sounds.white blood cell count and neutrophil increase, typical x-ray findings are lung segment and leaf consolidation.the disease has a short course and can be cured by timely treatment with antibiotics such as penicillin."

            1. A variety of bacteria can cause lobar pneumonia, but the vast majority are streptococcus pneumoniae.streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive cocci, with a capsule, and its pathogenicity is due to the invasion of the capsule of the polymer polysaccharide to the tissue.a few are klebsiella, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus hemolyticus, haemophilus influenzae, and the like. \n
            2. When the body suffers from cold, excessive fatigue, drunkenness, cold, diabetes, and low immune function, the respiratory defense function is weakened. the bacteria invade the alveoli through the allergic reaction, the capillary permeability of the alveolar wall is enhanced, and the slurry and cellulose are exuded. \n
            3. The bacteria in the protein exudate rapidly multiply and spread to adjacent lung tissue through the alveolar hole or respiratory bronchi, affecting a segment of the lung or the entire lobe. The exudate of the spreading bacillus between the large leaves is caused by the dissemination of the leaf bronchus. large lobar pneumonia lesions begin in the local alveoli and spread rapidly to a segment of the lung or the entire lobules.the clinical onset is rapid and the course of disease is about one week.often started with high fever and aversion to cold, followed by chest pain, cough, cough and rust, difficulty breathing, and signs of lung consolidation and increased white blood cell count in peripheral blood."

  - text: "Respiratory failure is a condition in which your blood doesn't have enough oxygen or has too much carbon dioxide. Sometimes you can have both problems. When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen. The oxygen passes into your blood, which carries it to your organs. Your organs, such as your heart and brain, need this oxygen-rich blood to work well."

  - text: "Prevention of respiratory failure:-\n
            1. refraining from smoking cigarettes, which can damage the lungs\n
            2. if necessary, using assistive devices to maintain oxygen levels, such as continuous positive airway pressure masks, which a person can wear at home\n

            1. Respiratory syncytial virus enters the body through the eyes, nose or mouth. It spreads easily through the air on infected respiratory droplets. You or your child can become infected if someone with RSV coughs or sneezes near you. The virus also passes to others through direct contact, such as shaking hands.\n
            2. The virus can live for hours on hard objects such as countertops, crib rails and toys. Touch your mouth, nose or eyes after touching a contaminated object and you're likely to pick up the virus."

  utter_acute_respiratory_failure/description:
  - text: "Acute respiratory failure occurs when fluid builds up in the air sacs in your lungs. When that happens, your lungs can’t release oxygen into your blood. In turn, your organs can’t get enough oxygen-rich blood to function. You can also develop acute respiratory failure if your lungs can’t remove carbon dioxide from your blood."

  utter_acute_respiratory_failure/causes:
  - text: "Causes of acute respiratory failure:-\n
            1. Obstruction:- When something lodges in your throat, you may have trouble getting enough oxygen into your lungs. Obstruction can also occur in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma when an exacerbation causes the airways to become narrow.\n
            2. Injury:- An injury that impairs or compromises your respiratory system can adversely affect the amount of oxygen in your blood. For instance, an injury to the spinal cord or brain can immediately affect your breathing. The brain tells the lungs to breathe. If the brain can’t relay messages due to injury or damage, the lungs can’t continue to function properly. An injury to the ribs or chest can also hamper the breathing process. These injuries can impair your ability to inhale enough oxygen into your lungs."    

  utter_neonatal_respiratory_distress_syndrome(RDS)/description:
  - text: "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) occurs in babies born early (premature) whose lungs are not fully developed. The earlier the infant is born, the more likely it is for them to have RDS and need extra oxygen and help breathing."

  utter_neonatal_respiratory_distress_syndrome(RDS)/prevention:
  - text: "Prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome(RDS):-
            1. Preventing a premature birth is the main way to prevent RDS. When a premature birth can’t be prevented, you may be given corticosteroids before delivery. These medicines may greatly lower the risk and severity of RDS in the baby. These steroids are often given between 24 and 34 weeks of pregnancy to women at risk of early delivery. They may sometimes be given up to 37 weeks."

  utter_neonatal_respiratory_distress_syndrome(RDS)/causes:
  - text: "Causes of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome(RDS):-
            1. RDS occurs when there is not enough surfactant in the lungs. Surfactant is a liquid made by the lungs that keep the airways (alveoli) open. This liquid makes it possible for babies to breathe in the air after delivery. An unborn baby starts to make surfactant at about 26 weeks of pregnancy. If a baby is premature (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), he or she may not have made enough surfactant yet.
            2. When there is not enough surfactant, the tiny alveoli collapse with each breath. As the alveoli collapse, damaged cells collect in the airways. They further affect breathing. The baby has to work harder and harder to breathe trying to reinflate the collapsed airways.
            3. As the baby's lung function gets worse, the baby takes in less oxygen. More carbon dioxide builds up in the blood. This can lead to increased acid in the blood (acidosis). This condition can affect other body organs. Without treatment, the baby becomes exhausted trying to breathe and over time gives up. A ventilator must do the work of breathing instead."

  utter_inhalation_injury/description:
  - text: "Inhalation injury is a nonspecific term that refers to damage to the respiratory tract or lung tissue from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants carried into the airway during inspiration. The term is often used synonymously with smoke inhalation injury."

            1. At home, practice fire safety, which includes preventing fires and having a plan in case there is a fire\n
            2. If there is smoke from a wildfire nearby or lots of particulate pollution in the air, try to limit your time outdoors. Keep your indoor air as clean as possible, by keeping windows closed and using an air filter. If you have asthma, another lung disease, or heart disease, follow your health care provider's advice about your medicines and respiratory management plan.\n
            3. If you are working with chemicals or gases, handle them safely and use protective equipment"

  utter_inhalation_injury/causes:
  - text: "Causes of inhalation injury:-\n
            1. the main cause of inhalation injury is thermal action, but at the same time, a large amount of unburned smog, carbon particles, and irritating chemicals are also inhaled, which also damages the respiratory tract and alveoli. therefore, inhalation damage is mixed damage from heat and chemicals."

  utter_pediatric_cold/description:
  - text: "The common cold (upper respiratory infection) is one of the most common illnesses in children. Each year it leads to more healthcare provider visits and missed days from school and work than any other illness. Here are a few facts:\n
            1. Most children will have at least 6 to 8 colds a year. Children who go to daycare will have more.\n
            2. Colds may occur less often after age 6.\n

            2. Teach children to wash their hands often. Have them wash their hands before eating, and after using the bathroom, playing with animals, or coughing or sneezing. Carry an alcohol-based hand gel for times when soap and water aren’t available. The gel should be at least 60% alcohol.\n
            3. Remind children not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth.\n
            4. Make sure toys and play areas are correctly cleaned, especially if several children are playing together."

  utter_pediatric_cold/causes:
  - text: "Causes of pediatric cold:-\n
            1. Through the air- If a person with cold sneezes or coughs, small amounts of the virus can go into the air. Then if your child breathes in that air, the virus will stick inside your child’s nose (nasal membrane).\n
            2. By direct contact- This means that your child touches an infected person. A cold is easy for children to spread. That’s because they touch their nose, mouth, and eyes often and then touch other people or objects. This can spread the virus. It’s important to know that viruses can be spread through objects, such as toys, that have been touched by someone with a cold."
